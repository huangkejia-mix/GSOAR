# GSOAR
This is a new framework for outdoor AR modeling, including the code for implementing methods, test code, test data results, etc.

# How to use
All the code is stored in the Code folder, which contains the implementation code for each core chapter, and the implementation code for the flowchart in Figure 3.and the implementation code for the flowchart in Figure 3. Dedicated test logic and code are designed for each chapter.

We also encapsulate legitimating legible functions for each of the basic functions and store them in GSOAR_Basic_Utils files. See estimate_coordinate_anchor, estimate_gravity_normal, calculate_slam_global_error, calculate_RTK_GPS_real_time_diff_std, coordinate_transform, estimate_true_north, estimate_gravity_normal, estimate_global_pose and other functions.
